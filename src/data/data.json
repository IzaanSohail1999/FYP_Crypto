The data for both currencies was analyzed in three different intervals: i) 2013 April 1 - 2016 April 1, ii) 2013 April 1 -  2017 April 1, and iii) 2013 April 1 -  2019 December 31st. These 3 intervals were used to compare with the models given by [36]. More than 700 technical indicators were included in the data. Using the feature selection methods outlined later in the document, a set of features were chosen. Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), Standard Deviation (STD), Variance (VAR), Triple Moving Exponential (TRIX), and Rate of Change(ROC)  are some of the technical indicators. These technical indicators are calculated over three, seven, fourteen, thirty, and ninety days.The end-of-day closing prices are regarded as raw values. Table 2 lists the raw attributes that these technical indicators are based on. Technical indicators display properties not immediately apparent in raw data, such as variances and standard deviations as a function of time. These technical indicators were created to display these aspects in the BTC and ETH price time-series. For example, instead of merely showing the raw transactions and hashrates, they illustrate how the ETH or BTC price is related to the standard deviation of the transactions or hashrate across 14 day intervals."

Sklearn Simple imputer was used to fill the missing data in the dataframe using the most frequently used strategy and fit transform together to increase model accuracy.The cleaned data was then turned into a data frame, resulting in a two-dimensional data set with rows and columns.Using the sklearn library function train test split, the data was split into test and train groups, with the test size set to 33% of the total data and random state of 42 to control the  shuffling before splitting data. The features were scaled using the minmax scaler for training the LSTM model. The features are shifted between 0 and 1 with the minmax scaling, while the relative magnitude of the outliers is preserved. The shape of the original distribution is preserved by MinMaxScaler. It has no effect on the information included in the original data."

An LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies between time steps of sequence data.This deep learning model is very beneficial for time-series data modeling and forecasting. Because the daily Bitcoin and Ethereum price and its characteristics are time series data, LSTM may be used to make price forecasts. The diagram below illustrates the architecture of a simple LSTM network for regression. The network starts with a sequence input layer followed by an LSTM layer. The network ends with a fully connected layer and a regression output layer.A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate (i), an output gate (o) and a forget gate (f). The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. The equations for the gates, cell state , candidate cell state and the final output in LSTM are given by:"

          "A successful forecasting system design includes developing and executing processes to monitor the performance of the forecasting model. Regardless of how well the forecasting model initially performs, It is expected that its performance may decline over time. The time series pattern may shift due to internal inertial forces. The forces that drive the process may change over time or as a result of external factors and  additional clients entering the market. A change in the level or slope of the variable being projected, for example, could occur. It's also feasible that the data's intrinsic unpredictability will rise. As a result, performance monitoring is critical. A cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart is a type of control chart used to monitor small shifts in the process mean. It uses the cumulative sum of deviations from a target.The CUSUM chart plots the cumulative sum of deviations from the target for individual measurements or subgroup means[29].The CUSUM is highly useful in detecting changes in the monitored variable's level. It operates by accumulating deviations above the desired goal value T0 (typically zero or the average forecast error) with one statistic C+ and deviations below the target with another statistic C. The higher and lower CUSUMs are the statistics C+ and C, respectively[37]. For implementing CUSUM on our models firstly variance of the entire list of predicted values was calculated along with standard-deviation(std). After which the std was divided by the number(n) of values predicted and boundary limits were defined by multiplying the standard-deviation with 3. A graph represented in figure 6 was plotted representing all predicted values along with upper and lower limit to determine how many values fell in range.Depending on the number of values in range it is decided where to train the model again with recent data to get improved accuracy and precision in predicted values."
